# Advent of Code 2025 🎄
## It's the most wonderful time of the year.. 

Welcome to my Advent of Code solutions for 2025. I’m using this repository to track my progress, test ideas, and keep my approaches consistent across the month. Each day has its own folder, input file, and TypeScript solutions. I run everything with Bun for fast iteration and simple tooling. If you’re working through the puzzles too, you can compare notes or borrow anything here that helps!

> I’ve solved Advent of Code every year since 2020. Until now I kept my solutions private, but for 2025 I decided to publish everything as I go.

## What is Advent of Code?
[Eric Wastl](https://was.tl/), the creator of the Advent of Code challenge describes it as:
> An Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.<br>

Each day consists of two puzzles. To complete the challenge, you must solve all of the puzzles by December 25th. 

## How to run

Install [Bun](https://bun.sh), then run any part file directly:

```typescript
bun 01/part1.ts```

Each day folder includes part files and an input file. The scripts load input automatically and print the formatted answer.

I also keep a blog displaying my thoughts, views and opinions on each day's problem and how I went about solving it. You can find that [here](https://kie.ac/blog/advent)!
