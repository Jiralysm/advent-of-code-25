# Advent of Code 2025 🎄

Welcome to my AoC 2025 solutions. I’m using this repository to follow my journey, try out ideas and keep my strategies coherent throughout the month. Every day has a folder, input file and solutions in TypeScript. I use Bun for quick iteration and low friction tools. If you are solving the puzzles yourself, you’ll have an opportunity to compare notes or snag anything here that may help!

> I’ve solved Advent of Code every year since 2020. Until now I kept my solutions private, but for 2025 I decided to publish everything as I go.

## What is Advent of Code?
[Eric Wastl](https://was.tl/), the creator of the Advent of Code challenge describes it as:
> An Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.<br>

Each day consists of two puzzles. To complete the challenge, you must solve all of the puzzles by December 25th. 

## How to run

Install [Bun](https://bun.sh), then run any part file directly:

```typescript
bun 01/part1.ts
```

Each day folder includes part files and an input file. The scripts load input automatically and print the formatted answer.

I also keep a blog displaying my thoughts, views and opinions on each day's problem and how I went about solving it. You can find that [here](https://kie.ac/blog/advent)!
